NRO realizes this vision senior management has defined a strategic management process that will focus the organization on fulfilling its present and future commitments The strategic management approach in effect at the NRO identifies the organization's vision for the fun1re characterizes its mission and delineates ten strategic goals Accompanying these goals is a comprehensive list of strategies required to achieve each goal and measures to monitor progress toward their accomplishment This strategic management process has given NRO senior leaders new insight into the impact that program dollars arc having today and has helped to suggest constructive directions for future intelligence coJiection initiatives U Collectively the goals actions and measures make up the 1999 to 2004 NRO Strategic Plan This document has been prepared to explain the plan both in terms of the strategic direction that has been set and the process that is in place to ensure that we reach our vision 1 1 Background Information U U The NRO was established in 1961 as a covert agency responsible for the development and management of the United States satellite reconnaissance effort For more than thirty years the NRO has provided U S policy makers and military planners with intelligence pertaining to worldwide events that threaten or might threaten U S national security interests NRO reconnaissance satellite systems have tracked weapons and missile developments military operations order of battle information nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction environmental industrial and agricultural production and activities with national policy implications 'fS1 - he NRO has proven to be a unique source of inte11igence to U S policy makers military planners and others concerned with our national security NRO satellite reconnaissance systems have allowed the U S to collect an increasing volume of detailed intelligence not previously available In addition NRO technological requirements have driven innovative scientific and technological developments in space U The NRO occupies a unique position at the intersection of military and national policy intelligence - gathering operations The DNRO reports jointly to the Secretary of Defense SECDEF and the Director of Central Intelligence DCI each of whom relics on NRO product' and each of whom makes major contributions of people fonds infrastructure and other resources to the NRO 1 2 NRO History of Strategic Planning U U Corporate strategic planning has been an important function in the NRO since the late 1980s The first strategic review was documented in a report written by retired Rear Admiral Robert Geiger and Mr Barry Kelly in 1989 The report identified three challenges facing the NRO 1 maintaining its leadership role in the development of creative system responses to requirements 2 improving its understanding of and responsiveness to national and military operational requirements and 3 assuming a more proactive role in the Intelligence Community IC and Department of Defense DoD communities The report recommended that the NRO reorganize and collocate to ensure greater cohesion As part of this reorganization a new Plans and Analysis Office was created One of the principal tasks for the Plans and Analysis Office was to provide a capability to develop and maintain a strategic plan U By April 1992 the first NRO Strategic Plan had been developed written and published At the same time another significant report had a major impact on the NRO and its culture The Director of Central intelligence DC Task Force on the NRO chaired by Robert Fuhrman made recommendations for further organizational restructuring collocation of all major elements in the Washington D C area and the declassification of the existence of the NRO U These recommendations had far - reaching impacts on the strategic direction of the NRO Once the existence of the NRO was made public a series of actions were taken to satisfy the desire for greater openness about NRO activities and to integrate these activities with those of other organizations This transition increased the complexity ofNRO system development launch and operations The NRO budget came under greater scrutiny in both the Legislative and Executive branches Finally the industrial base supporting the NRO began downsizing and currently is still in a period of consolidation and transition Page 1 - l llaodle la lft'Et l Mi T r Ll iNT 1Gs¥110LE Chaanels J9intt Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 - - - - - - · - - - ···

the United States IC The Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U S Intelligence Community chaired by former Defense Secretary Harold Brown and later by former Senator and Defense Secretary Les Asp in described the processes needed to work with mission partners and customers An IC 2000 document issued in March 1996 by Congressman Larry Combest then Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence HPSCij reemphasized the need for the NRO and its strategic mission partners to work together NRO relationships w ith its customers and mission partners continue to represent some of our most fundamental opportunities and challenges U Following his appointment as the new NRO Acting Director in March 1996 Mr Keith Hall established a panel of experts beaded by retired Admiral David Jeremiah to provide the next Director of the NRO DNRO with recommendations that would defme the NRO in the coming years The Jeremiah Panel was asked to address a series of major issues Their response became an important component of the current strategic foundation of the NRO The panel was formed during a time when the NRO was facing many challenges such as increased requirements for spending accountability consolidation of satellite missions and external oversight The panel recommended that the mission of the NRO in the 21st Century should be to revolutionize space reconnaissance to enable U S global information superiority In addition based on the needs of both the SECDEF and the DCI the panel asserted the imperdtive for the NRO to provide affordable near - continuous global coverage The panel's findings were reflected in the strategic planning process that followed under the Director's leadership and guidance 1 3 The NRO Performance - Based Strategic Management Process U U The NRO has created a strategic management process that can be sustained over time From the onset the NRO approach has recognized the importance of products including a strategic plan and other forms of communication but the predominant focus bas been on building a framework to support strategic management U Figure l introduces the NRO strategic management process from initial planning through an ongoing cycle of maintenance implementation and improvement The key attributes ofthis process are that it is iterdtive and evolutionary Successful strategic management requires planning execution and monitoring of results and relies on appropriate feedback loops to ensure that the strategic focus is updated to reflect the organization's needs as they change over time • Ill I Ill - - II rt III - DB - - Iii - - l m ' - II II I Um f r sifie cl Figure 1 U The NRO Strategic Management Process U The following characteristics have been important factors in the development deployment and maturation of a successful strategic management process at the NRO Senior management commitment and participation Page 1 - 2 Haudlc la 11¥1 H I t 'fA t Efff•KiY 'IIOL£ Channels Joiutt Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 C05106746 Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 • Senior leader ownership of process and products • Clear well - crafted and broadly communicated vision mission and goals • Wide participation in formulating and implementing the details Effective measurement and outcome feedback Specific individual and organizational acc - 0untability for all activities and outcomes U To develop a strategic management system with these characteristics the NRO has made a significant investment of time and effort starting with the Director and the senior management team A series of off - sites provided the initial forum for assessing the environment discussing alternate strategies and developing consensus The Jeremiah Panel Report was a key input to these early efforts This document included an environmental analysis as well as a proposed mission statt - ment that was later adopted as the NRO corporate mission statement During these retreats the senior leadership team established a corporate - wide vision statement and identified core values necessary to fulfill the charter of the NRO They also agreed to fundamental strategic initiatives to cope with changing mission requirements emerging technologies and new customer needs This strategic planning process was conceived and implemented prior to the Office of Management and Budget 0MB decision that the IC and its members would be required to comply with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 U The NRO elected to use the Balanced Scorecard as a template for goal setting and performance measurement development The NRO senior leaders identified four perspectives for the Balanced Scorecard customer satisfaction process improvement employee satisfaction and financial management Once goals were defined within each perspective the DNRO assigned goal managers - - senior leadership team members accountable for achievement of each goal Each goal manager was empowered by the Director to serve in a corporate capacity across the organization to move the organization toward goal achievement Since the corporate goals transcend any sub - organization and have NRO - wide impact most goal managers have created - Toss - functional cross - unit teams to develop goal descriptions goal outcomes and candidate measures and to execute action plans U The NRO is currently working to develop performance measures that can be used to monitor progress toward achieving corporate goals Like the goals these measures are being identified in the four Balanced Scorecard perspectives Efforts a re under way to link goal perfonnance measures to outcomes and to identify performance targets based on anticipated result - from action plan execution In addition the NRO is beginning to assess how current programs will affect performance in the future The first full year of performance data will be collected in FY99 1 3 1 U Directorate and Office Performance Planning An important aspect of the NRO strategic planning process is its application at all levels of the organization The Directorates and Offices D Os of the NRO are currently working to establish organizational strategies that will support accomplishment of the corporate goals Their effort is the bridge from the corporate - level strategic direction to program management and budget allocation While each Director is in the process of creating goals action plans and measures to implement the NRO corporate - wide plan each D O has begun a similar strategic management process that should link all levels of the organization strategically to the accomplishment of the corporate plan The basic steps in the process at the D O level mirror the process already described for the NRO corporate - level 1 3 2 U Strategic Planning Process Management In addition to normal implementation initiatives such as performance measurement and reporting senior - level engagement is ensured through several ongoing mechanisms First each quarter the senior management team engages in broad multi - day comprehensive strategic management sessions to assess the strategic performance of the NRO and progress against the current plan Second the weekly senior staff meeting agenda includes on - going performance review discussions to track outcomes from strategic initiatives Additional mechanisms include quarterly corporate Performance Reviews and Quarterly Program Reviews addressed at greater length in Section 7 0 Program Evaluation U These mechanisms ensure continued senior participation in both the detailed work of strategic management and the overall assessment of the process Because strategic planning is a living process the NRO fully anticipates that goals and measures will change over time - - these mechanisms will provide the opportunity for evaluation and recalibration of the NR O strategic direction when necessary U To assist the senior Leadership team with the management of this process a strategic planning staff element which reports directly to the DNRO was created The role of this staff element is to support and facilitate the corporate process and to provide Page 1 - 3 llliidle la B fiH l A - Nf T 1 lll T Ki' '¥AQl i f llaaael1 Joinll9r Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 C05106746 Approved for Release 2017 12 04 005106746 - SECitE - U Cont analytical expertise to action implementation teams Similar support is provided to D O strategic planning efforts on an as - needed basis 1 3 3 U Communication of the Strategic Direction to the Workforce Communication with the NRO workforce is an important factor in internalizing the NRO strategic direction Mechanisms have been put into place to report on the corporate progress towards goal accomplishment Products are displayed and updated on a strategic planning Website and through the use of brochures posters and articles in the NRO's Reconnaissance 'RECON' Magazine Quarterly Town Hall Meetings run by the Director regularly address issues of strategic direction In addition goal and measurement reviews are conducted through the Program Managers' Quarterly Forum The first NRO Organizational Climate Survey relied on several methods for communicating survey results including a presentation at an NRO Town Hall Meeting and individual feedback packages for each D O program office and worldwide location Detailed survey results sent to individual offices allowed supervisors and staff to review staff perceptions on a question - by - question basis 1 4 Organization of the NRO Strategic Plan U U The following pages contain the details of the NRO Strategic Plan for 1999 to 2004 The shared corporate vision mission values and goals are included in Section 2 0 In Sections 3 0 - 6 0 the detailed strategies for each of the four Balanced Scorecard perspectives are presented The core content of these sections is provided through two standard matrices The first matrix displays the linkage between the NRO corporate goals associated outcomes performance measures and their associated baselines and targets and data sources The second matrix identifies outcome action plans accountable offices for each measure timelines related resources not currently programmed in the budget cycle and the relationship between strategic goals and outcome goals In addition the Customer Satisfaction Internal Process Employee Satisfaction and Financial Management perspective sections discuss external factors impeding goal accomplishment strategies to achieve goals and data capacity Section 7 0 introduces the NRO's program evaluation process NRO statutory provisions congressional and stakeholder consultations major management problems and cross - cutting functions are presented in Section 8 0 All elements required by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 are addressed in this document Page 1 - 4 S CM T Ha11tllc • ia Brtl l'tl m' T71 Ll NT lfflYfl6LE

AND CORPORATE GOALS U Senior management began charting the strategic direction for the NRO by developing the vision mission and value statements These statements serve to identify future priorities help focus organiz ational activities on a common pmpose and provide a foundation upon which programmatic goals and actions can later be built Figure 2 U The NRO Vision U In the Fall of 1996 Mr Hall and his leadership team conducted an off - site session to identify a vision for the organization They sought a vision that could provide the momentum for change and communicate a clear direction to the workforce During this off - site the senior leaders concluded that global reconnaissance would continue to be the core mission ofthe NRO with two central points of emphasis First the NRO must revolutionize global reconnaissance to ensure U S information superiority Second the NRO must act as one team effective working relationships both internal and external are essential as the NRO proceeds into the 21st century This vision illustrated in Figure 2 has been widely disseminated throughout the NRO and the Intelligence Community IC U When developing its mission statement the NRO focused on describing its purpose and core functions while explaining why it must exist as a unique entity Senior management had carefully reviewed the Jeremiah Panel report and opted to retain the Panel's characterization ofthe NRO mission illustrated in Figure 3 The adopted statement which had been previously approved by both the Secretary ofDefense SECDEF and the Director ofCentral Intelligence DCI succinctly captured the NRO mission Page 2 - 1 IIH1He ia B YEP tANf Tl115151 lT Im¥119 _ lli Ch•aaels Jeiatlf Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 C05106746 Approved for Release

it executes its mission The capstone of these values is satisfying our customers Customer satisfaction depends on our commitment to our mission the relationships developed between government and industrial partners teamwork and diversity and team members who are innovative and creative The foundation of all NRO values lies in the principle of integrity - - in relationships with each other our community and NRO stakeholders NRO values are shown in Figure 4 Enable U S Global Information Superiority During Peace Thro ugh War The NRO is Responsible for the Unique and Innovative Technology

senior leadership off - site conducted in January 1997 Over 50 senior leaders from the Directorates and Offices D O's and staff offices provided input which resulted in a list of over 80 candidate goals Over the next month the corporate Board of Directors which consists of the Director the Deputy Director the Deputy Director of Resource Oversight Management the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Directors of Military and National Support modified merged and developed the first corporate goal statements To ensure that aU levels of the organization were represented in the goal development

Enable U S global information superiority requires that the NRO fully understand and respond to the needs of a widespread and diverse customer base The customer base includes two key groups - - mission partners and users Mission partners include a number of agencies within the Intelligence Community IC that depend on us and we on them to perform our mission If either partner fails the user suffers Users include the National Command Authority the Central Intclligcncc Agency CIA the Joint Chicfa of Staff and the unified commands the Military Services the Department of State and Justice to name a few Many users with extensive background in our capabilities make substantial use of our collective products and services to accomplish their mission The NRO is also attempting to reach out to non - traditional customers who have previously been unable to use our products because of the lack ofknowledge of them or lack of the enabling infrastructure in support of their missions U These customers are the primary driver of our strategic planning process our future depends on our ability to identify their needs and provide products and services that meet those needs Three strategic goals have been identified to address the important relationship between the NRO and the customer The focus of these goals underscore our commitment to providing our customers with the best possible service while also laying the groundwork to advance the organization closer to achieving its vision of Revolutionizing Global Reconnaissance Goal 1 Provide Assured Timely Global Coverage U U Our customers must feel confident that they can ask for and receive information responsive to their needs Access should be provided to any region of the globe with the ability to provide near - continuous coverage when required Rapid availability and access to data in a form that will support customer's mission success must be provided Goal 2 Provide Tailored Information On - Demand to Customers Worldwide U U This goal addresses NRO tailoring of data provided by space - based collectors in response to customer mission based requirements It addresses processing storage and NRO capabilities to provide customer access to data by whatever means to meet customer needs Accomplishment of the goal will result in improved processing storage and dissemination Goal 3 Team with Our Mission Partners to Establish and Maintain Strong Relationships with Our Customers U U Strong customer relationships are necessary to engender trust and confidence between NRO and the customers ofits products and services Customers must know how to reach the NRO when necessary and have an adequate opportunity to influence NRO decisions programs and operations Likewise NRO needs to understand the Customers' mission and operational and programmatic environments to have a full appreciation of Customer needs However strong NRO - customer relationships alone are insufficient to ensure customer satisfaction NRO depends heavily on its mission partners NSA NIMA CMO USSP ACECOM CIA and DIA to participate in defining customer requirements tasking NRO systems and processing exploiting and disseminating NRO data and products where and when they are needed NRO relationships with customers must therefore include teamwork with its mission partners to ensure customers are satisfied with the timeliness availability and usability of NRO products and services 3 2 Strategic Initiatives U U The following are examples offuture systems and management initiatives that the NRO is pursuing These efforts are focused on making our customers more successful in accomplishing their missions while improving their satisfaction with the products and services provided by the NRO 3 2 1 U Future System Initiatives The NRO has two major future systems initiatives that are focused on improving customer satisfaction These programs are the Future Imagery Architecture FIA and the Integrated Overhead SIGINT Architecture IOSA b 1 b 3 Page3 - 2 Handle ta WfE fA - N 'f LEN'f E 118LE Chanuelduiutl Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 C05106746 Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 SECRE r i BOBti Commanders in Chief CINCs and the Joint Chiefs of Staff JCS to refine functional and performance requirements for future imagery capability The FIA acquisition strategy is to provide statements of requirements capabilities and objectives to industry to encourage a wider range of potential solutions from the contractors b 1 b 3 3 2 2 U Management Initiatives The NRO has also launched a number of management improvement initiatives that focus on improving customer support and developing a System of Systems Architecture SOSA to integrate collection processing and dissemination of data U Consistent with the findings of the Jeremiah Panel the NRO is developing a more centrnlized management strategy for customer support Efforts to improve NRO customer support include the development of an organization wide directive as well as a detailed NRO - wide Customer Support Implementation Plan CSIP Additionally a Customer Support Board CSB has been created to improve internal communication and help articulate NRO policy and priorities for all customer support activities U The SOSA office was established to develop an integrated space reconnaissance architecture which will improve our customers' ability to accomplish their missions while simultaneously allowing them to reduce costs SOSA will improve customer effectiveness by integrating and synchronizing NRO space reconnaissance operations with customer operations This will be accomplished with consistent standards a common data and operating environment and integration of collection processing and dissemination into a system of systems architecture The increased synthesis of satellite airborne and ground based sensors will ensure that multiple data sources are available to provide information that is delivered faster to all global customers 3 3 Key External Factors Impeding Goal Accomplishment U 3 3 1 U Limited Direct Accountability to End - Users A key challenge for the NRO and its mission partners is to effectively coordinate Intelligence Community efforts to provide timely relevant and accurate intelligence products While the NRO acquires and operates space - based reconnaissance systems it relies heavily on its mission partners to lead in the requirements tasking processing exploitation and dissemination of intelligence products 3 3 2 U Changing Customer Requirements Our customers operate in a dynamic environment of constant change that requires the NRO to be flexible and responsive in the products and services we provide and the systems we build 3 3 3 U Budget The extent to which the NRO can provide assured timely global coverage and tailored infonnation ondemand to custom1 TS worldwide is heavily dependent on budget stability Major fluctuations in the NRO budget could affect the extent to which the NRO can be responsive to its customers needs 3 3 4 £ir New and Developing Non - Traditional Customers NRO outreach has traditionally been focused on support to miJitary and strategic intelligence customers As the world is changing so too must the NRO we have begun to seek out nontraditional customers to include civil and environmental customers and federal law enforcement agencies These new customers are key players in the developing threats to world order and support to critical US national interest and security issues NRO systems' utility against the substantive information needs of transnational law law enforcement and environmental customers are governed by law and executive order Interpretations of these laws and applicable intelligence community policies make it difficult to provide the needed level of support In addition the policies and procedures in place to support these customers have not matured sufficiently to support any but their most rudimentary needs llaalll11 ¥ia IIY i Pil t NI Page3 - 3 T AtLEN't'•lffl·i'tl6Lfl €banuets fointl Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 - · - ······· - - - - - CO5106746 Approved for Release 2017 12 04

with an unparalleled space reconnaissance capability Today in order to sustain this capability we strive to remain at the forefront of technology and to apply these innovative technologies to the satellites acquired and operated by the NRO Additionally the NRO has attempted to raise the standard for both satellite acquisition and operations through numerous process improvement initiatives This commitment to internal process improvement has enabled us to better serve customers which ultimately serves to strengthen U S national security Goal 4 Be the Government's Best System Acquisition and Operations Organization U U Our systems acquisition and operations are and should be the standard for the rest of the government We need to be the undisputed leader in our efficiencies and in the effectiveness of our processes Goal 5 Conduct an Aggressive Customer Focused Research and Development Program that Fosters Innovation and Creativity U U This goal addresses our development and application of advanced concepts and technologies to space reconnaissance and services and related systems Advanced concept demonstrations investments in mission - unique areas exploitation of commercial technologies and leveraging via government and industrial partnerships are examples of activities that we will pursue 4 2 Strategic Initiatives U U The following are examples of strategic initiatives that focus on the NRO's three primary processes research and development acquisition and operations These initiatives have been instrumental in moving the NRO toward accomplishing the process improvement goals 4 2 l U Emphasis on Revolutionary Technology The NRO vision statement reiterates a commitment to revolutionizing global reconnaissance To accomplish this revolution the NRO is championing the development of technological solutions to solve the industry's most challenging information problems Examples of some initiatives that focus on fostering these enabling technologies include a change in the management of research and development and an investment in new revolutionary technologies I n 1997 the NRO combined numerous internal research and development activities into a single Advanced Systems and Technology Directorate AS TD Additionally the NRO has increased its traditional research and development investment level from six percent of the budget to ten percent to ensure our efforts are afforded the greatest opportunity for success b 1 b 3 4 2 2 U Acquisition Improvement Because the NRO recognizes that its future depends on how well it acquires systems today the NRO has initiated a number of programs that focus on improving the acquisition process within the NRO Examples of these types of initiatives include the Acquisition Steering Group ASG the Acquisition Center of Excellence ACE and the FASTMAX contract vehicle U The ASG was formed to ensure that acquisition reform initiatives are shared throughout the NRO This monthly forum is chaired by the Deputy Director of the NRO DDNRO and is represented by each Directorate and Office D O In addition to the ASG the NRO established the ACE for the purpose of identifying best acquisition practices The ACE frequently interacts with external agencies to discover and implement these practices It provides program directors from the NRO and its mission partners with the critical support tools and the expertise necessary to conduct efficient streamlined acquisition of national priority Page4 - 2 SECRET JIHflle ia RWH N TALENT DUIQLE ChH1tel1 Jeiat · Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746

significant cross - flow of information between the various directorates offices and staff elements 4 2 3 ft 8'f Operations Improvements In addition to the many programs that have been undertaken to improve acquisition the NRO has initiated several improvements to the operation of the satellite ground stations The NRO is 4 3 Key External Factors Impeding Goal Accomplishment U 4 3 1 U Shifting Customer Requirements NRO programs are affected by rapidly changing customer requirements and priorities These shifting customer requirements could make it difficult to accomplish our acquisition and operations goal because the satellites acquired and operated by the NRO may not be able to change priorities as rapidly as customers requirements can shift Additionally accomplishment of our research and development goal could conflict with changing customer requirements by its very nature research and development is a time - consuming process that may result in some dead ends and redirection as customer needs change In order to mitigate the effects of shifting customer requirements a variety of user exchange forums and requirements data calls are frequently used to review all NRO programs against current user needs These forums help to ensure that the NRO understands and adjusts appropriately to changes in customer requirements 4 3 2 U Changes in the Space Industry Over the last few years the U S space industry has undergone significant changes such as commercialization the ability to mass produce small highly capable satellites and on - going technological improvements in sensors materials and data processing and storage technologies Failure to adjust to these innovations could potentially have an impact on the NRO goal of being the best system acquisition and operations organization in the government as well as our goal to foster a customer - focused research and development effort U The NRO approach to revolutionizing global reconnaissance is highly dependent on collaboration with other government organizations and private corporations in the aerospace industry A downturn or slowdown in this industry would not only force a change in the NRO approach but it could also potentially limit our ability to leverage common industry products and services e NRO approach to improving our acquisition and operations processes is to move from cost - incentive contracting to more firm - fixed price procurements allowing us to buy - on - orbit Without a robust space industry that provides common services to many customers the NRO will be required to invest more heavily in common services as opposed to the technologies unique to our mission However upward trends in the space industry are expected to continue and the NRO is capitalizing on these trends through internal process actions and initiatives such as the establishment of AS TD and the ACE and the further consolidation of operational ground processing sites These efforts are focused on reducing current operations and acquisitions costs and maximizing future NRO investment potential 4 3 3 U Budget Limitations As overhead intelligence needs change and innovations in technology offer improved collection and dissemination options the NRO is investing a higher percentage of funding into revolutionary research and development efforts Major fluctuations in the budget can have a serious impact on the accomplishment ofNRO research and development acquisition and operations goals It is critical as the NRO implements a more commercial approach to acquisition that it maintains a consistent program baseline As the NRO moves away from cost - driven contracts for major systems developments to a fixed - price procurement approach a stable set of customer requirements and a consistent funding profile become increasingly important Haallle ia B¥1 ltt lrt« f C Page 4 - 3 Sl lCH'I' Tl Li DYIIQLI c 11aaaels Jeiad9r Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 b 1 b 3 C05106746

the NRO to invest in the systems of the future In order to become Freedom's Sentinel in Space the NRO must adapt to changes in best business practices and operations concepts This will allow us to provide new capabilities and to continue the overall mission ofinfonnation superiority now and into the 21st Century In support of this goal two working groups have been developed one focusing on acquisition and the other on operations U On the acquisition side some initial tasks have been identified to enable NRO acquisition professionals to conduct their business more effectively and efficiently This begins with improving the common skills of all NRO acquisition professionals and developing greater consistency across NRO acquisition activities n addition to training the workforce other initiatives have been identified to improve the acquisition process One of the most promising is to establish a paperless environment of real - time communications with industry Another significant action is to identify acquisition standards in the government and private industry so that the NRO can conduct frequent infonnation exchanges This dialogue will concentrate on common contracting and programmatic issues in order to increase our awareness of the latest innovations and improvements Likewise the NRO will learn from these opportunities what internal areas are in need of improyement U As best practices are identified they will be reviewed by a panel to determine how to implement them within the NRO It will be essential to communicate these practices so that they can be used throughout the entire acquisition process A key element of this action plan is to integrate Earned Value Management onto the desktops of technical financial and program ffHildle Via B

effort a working group consisting of members from major operational sites and directorates has been established U The working group initiated the effort by defining the scope of operations and identifying the attributes that would make NRO operations the best The attributes of availability effectiveness and efficiency were identified and top level measures across NRO operations in these three categories arc being developed These measures will be used to obtain a baseJine of current NRO performance U Once the group has established a baseline it will begin to identify areas for improvement and make recommendations The focus will be placed on maximizing operational availability efficiency and effectiveness within the bounds of available resources Another possible way to improve operations is to reduce complexity in mission and payload these improvements in turn have the potential to reduce operational complexity and cost 4 4 3 U Relationship Between General Goals and Annual Performance Goals Each desired outcome of Goal 4 is supported by one or more candidate performance measures as listed in Table 4a This table also identifies known baselines and targets for the measures as well as the source of data The candidate performance measures have also been defined in detail in the data capacity section Table 4a serves as a preliminary glimpse of the performance measures and data sources to be used in the upcoming Annual Performance Plan 4 4 4 U Data Capacity The following measures are currently being tracked and will be used to measure progress toward the achievement of Goal 4 Acquisition Schedule Integrity Tracks program milestone changes against those originally planned and tracks program milestone achievement against the milestones established This measure shows overall schedule dynamics and is a leading indicator of schedule changes Analysis of this measure allows targets to be set for new programs as well as the monitoring of programs with high schedule risk U Earned Value The earned value measure is a key leading indicator of acquisition program performance This measure quantifies the amount of resources and time expended on acquisitions It integrates program scope schedule and cost objectives into a baseline plan against which accomplishments can be measured The measure also combines significant cost and schedule drivers and can be aggregated into a single NRO earned value composite view Additionally it can be used to compare NRO and similar DoD and NASA acquisition efforts U Operations Availability Measure This measure tracks the overall availability ofNRO operational assets Availability is a system performance parameter that is a ratio of the total accomplished executed mission time or imaging operations versus the total planned operational mission time or imaging operations Trend availability in terms of system complexity measures will also track system scheduled versus unscheduled outage time U Operations Effectiveness Operational effectiveness measures critical characteristics of the NRO operations output that meet customer requirements Although NRO data can be described by multiple characteristics that define effective operations a top level measure for NRO Operational effectiveness is data production volume and the corresponding loss rate U For imagery intelligence IMINT operations effectiveness is a measure of the volume ofNRO imagery products tracked over time as well as the loss or failure rate as a percentage of total volume b 1 b 3 U Operations Efficiency This efficiency measure for NRO operations addresses the efficiency with which our processes Handle • ia B'i'EM 'c 'iR'alent Ke hele '3haBBel11 Jei11 1 Page 4 • 10 Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746

identifying a baseline for the number of unique systems delivered to the ground stations we will be able to determine the level of standardization that has occurred The level of standardization is important because increased system complexity eads to increased system cost U NRO Commercial Acquisition Best Practices Survey The acquisition and operations best practices survey is an annual survey designed to gather information on commercial space system procurement and commercial space system operations practices The survey supports the acquisition and operations goal in the internal process perspective by gather information on • Customer supplier interactions • Acquisition procurement processes and planning • Spacecraft operations • Acquisition and operations best practices U The results of the survey will identify areas where the NRO can focus on improving acquisition and operations practices and will provide commercial perceptions of the best acquisition and operations organizations

source of data The candidate performance measures have also been defined in detail in the data capacity section Table Sa serves as a preliminary glimpse of the performance measures and data sources to be utilized in the upcoming Annual Performance Plan 4 5 4 U Data Capacity The following measures are currently being tracked and will be used to measure progress toward the achievement of Goal 5 U Projects with Identified Transition Dates This measure represents the first pillar of the NRO strategic elements customers This is the number of projects expressed as a percentage of the research and development budget that have a date identified for when they will be transitioned to customers This date will be jointly established by the customer and NRO The measure supports the R D goals of identifying and developing solutions to meet the needs of customers U Research and development programs throughout the government are often perceived as a collection of pet projects To avoid that perception the NRO research and development program clearly demonstrates a direct tie and commitment to customers and their toughest intelligence problems Research and development programs require strong support to provide consistent funding over the life cycle of a developing technology A strong supportive customer base is essential not only to maintain support but to provide frequent feedback on technology application and performance goals U CoUaboratively Funded Efforts Collaboration is the second fundamental principle underlying our strategic planning Collaborative projects are those that are partially funded by one of our technology allies or mission partners The level of funding from the outside organization must be significant defined as representing budget line items BLI level funding in their respective budgets - an amount that would be separately tracked and justified as a program This measure supports our goal of leveraging technologies outside the NRO U The NRO can not pursue solutions to the future reconnaissance challenges on its own Hard targets and intractable problems increasingly demand multisource intelligence collection Collaboration with partners and allies on joint projects will be essential The DNRO has the ability to influenccboth the unclassified and the classified space programs that will increasingly rely on similar advanced technology to provide information superiority U Our stakeholders and the American taxpayers are demanding a more efficient and effective space program that not only leverages technology investment but shares technologies and transfers them to the commercial sector for wider application U The fraction of the NRO research and development budget that is spent on collaborative projects is an indication of how aggressively we are pursuing collaborations U Revolutionary Projects in the Current Fiscal Year This measure addresses the third pillar of the AS T core strategic elements revolution Specifically this measure tracks projects expressed as a percentage of the research and development budget that can be defined as revolutionary in a given fiscal year The definition ofrevolutionary can be found in the AS T Strategic Plan One element for defining these projects is the five strategic thrusts • Solving hard targets • Orders of magnitude increase in efficiency and effectiveness • Solutions to intractable problems • Frontiers of exploitation and processing • Enabling space services This measure will provide the DNRO with insight into the rate at which the newly centralized research and development

Global Reconnaissance recognizes the important role that employees u timately have in the success ofthe NRO The One Team concept emphasizes that both government and contractor employees are the foundation ofNRO' s support to the Department of Defense DoD and the Intelligence Community IC The NRO has identified three goals in this perspective that focus on increasing employee satisfaction and improving our capability to excel in operating current systems acquiring future systems and conducting the revolutionary research mission partners and users demand Goal 6 Create and Maintain a World - Class NRO Workforce Who Will Revolutionize Global Reconnaissance U U People are the NRO's greatest asset The NRO team must be informed and empowered to meet the challenges of revolutionizing global reconnaissance Opportunities abound to contribute to and share in the NRO's success the objective is to maximize the NRO's potential by giving everyone the opportunity to engage in challenging work where efficient and effe - 1ive performance is rewarded equitably In turn we depend on each of our NRO team members to maintain the highest standards of integrity conduct and accountability Goal 7 Provide a Quality Work Environment that Enables Our Workforce to Excel U U Our workforce must feel that they receive the infrastructure necessary and appropriate to accomplish the mission ofthe NRO In this regard by providing appropriate facilities tools information handling and an improved quality oflife through available services the NRO can create an environment that will foster increases in employee productivity and satisfaction and ensure the retention of our world class workforce the latter being an important step in assuring continued support to the NRO' s stakeholder and customer needs To this end a quality environment one in which each and every employee knows the supporting infrastructure is there when needed will allow our workforce to continue to be Freedom's Sentinel in Space Goal 8 Develop a Streamlined Open Corporate Management Climate U U All employees arc critical to driving the continual evolution of the NRO's strategic direction Our corporate climate should foster the ability to perform the NRO's mission supported by an effective decision - making process and clear lines of communication We need to focus on eliminating non value - added processes emphasizing one team employees are the enabler ofour success S l Strategic Initiatives U U The following are examples of strategic initiatives that have been instrumental in moving the NRO toward accomplishment of the employee satisfaction goals S l l U Employee Development Since the inception of strategic planning at the NRO several human resource initiatives to improve the development of employees have been introduced Examples include the implementation of an employee performance recognition program and an evaluation of current training programs U The purpose of the employee performance recognition program is to create a unified One Team approach that establishes equity among employees The program was initiated to respond to the results of the first annual NRO Organizational Climate Survey that identified performance recognition as an area for improvement This - recognition program will provide greater opportunities for employees to be recognized for their contribution In addition this manager - driven program will delegate award approval authority and will give employees and managers greater access to award information U There are also initiatives underway to evaluate and improve NRO training programs Currently the Human Resources Management Group HRMG is assessing training needs and benchmarking training best practices throughout industry In addition the NRO is designing corporate education training and development programs with a core curriculum aligned to our strategic needs The Human Resources Management Group HRMG will provide competency - based training and development to promote a culture of continuous learning and professional growth Page S - 2 lla11dle • i11 B VGHl IW 'fi'ILEN'f JiEYIIOl ll '3haanels Joi l f Approved

number of organizational development improvement programs that have been helpful in identifying needed improvements throughout the organization Examples of these types of efforts include an Organizational Climate Survey and a workforce analysis U The Organizational Climate Survey provides NRO managers with a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the NRO as a place of employment The survey collects reliable data regarding employee perceptions of the NRO These perceptions are used by NRO managers at all levels throughout the organization to gain insight into aspects of the organizational climate that arc favorable to employees while also identifying aspects that require improvement The results of the first annual survey have been analyzed and have provided a baseline level of performance against which subsequent survey results can be compared U HRMG is conducting an analysis to ensure that the NRO workforce possesses the right set of skills to attain its vision of revolutionizing global reconnaissance The purpose of the analysis is to identify review and compare the NRO's current and future workforce needs Results of the analysis will help to determine the skills knowledge and abilities that will be needed to support our future roles and missions This analysis will also assist HRMG in identifying opportunities to enhance organizational effectiveness 5 3 Key External Facton Impeding Goal Accomplishment U 5 3 1 U Information Security Information security requirements could be an obstacle to implementing several of the strategies identified to achieve the goals in this perspective Information security concerns could delay the introduction of virtual offices and telecommuting concepts However the CIO will establish information technology policies to complement information exchange and business practices for all NRO Strategic Goals including Goal 7 Information technologies and policies should enable innovative business

with this effort the corporate level information flow processes were analyzed Adjustments to both of these processes were identified and some have already been implemented U An additional effort to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy within the organization was initiated This effort focused on baselining the NRO staff The study results revealed that the NRO staff had increased this resulted in a recommendation to reduce the size of the NRO staff clements by 10 percent by December 1998 U In order to improve the communication flow and involvement within the organization the Strategic Planning Office has begun several initiatives An organizational climate survey was developed and distributed to all NRO government employees to solicit feedback on employee perceptions of the work environment Additionally the Strategic Planning Office has begun to assist the organization as it deploys the strategic planning process throughout the organization in an effort to link employee perfonnance at

SECH'f 6 0 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE U 6 1 Introduction U U To achieve the NRO vision of revolutionizing global reconnaissance we must make optimal use of our fiscal resources Although fiscal constraints can seem burdensome thoughtful management of resources and appropriate use of program funding will ultimately act as a catalyst to the delivery of products that satisfy our customers' requirements This perspective focuses on improving NRO financial management systems and processes so that senior leaders can better manage NRO resources Goal 9 Develop and Sustain a Financial Management Process that Optimizes the Use of Our Resources U U This goal addresses our need for and commitment to building a financial management process that supports NRO managers at all levels This process must be efficient and provide the insight necessary for managers to effectively make complex and difficult resource decisions Goal 10 Ensure Government and Contractor Financial Systems Provide Reliable Timely and Accurate Information U U This goal brings together our vigilance over the expenditure of funds on both sides of the government contractor ledger The systems must provide reliable and accurate financial status to our managers and our stakeholders 6 2 Strategic Initiatives U U The following are examples of strategic initiatives that focus on improving our financial systems and processes These initiatives have been instrumental in moving the NRO toward accomplishing the corporate - level financial management goals 6 2 1 U Financial Management Process Reengineering As a result of the Joint Audit Report on NRO Financial Management Practices by the Central Intelligence Agency Department ofDefense Inspector General CIA DoDIG 30 April 1996 audit Congress required a complete revision of the NRO financial processes Officials from the Director of Central Intelligence's Del's Community Management Staff CMS and the DoD Comptroller's office required that the NRO conduct budget execution reviews and submit status reports of its financial health in order to provide proof of compliance These reviews created an environment for positive change New policies procedures and processes were developed to ensure that the budget for the NRO would be closely monitored in execution In addition a Management Control Program Directive was published to provide structure and direction for programmatic and budgetary compliance U Budgetary process mapping has allowed the NRO to efficiently and accurately align resources with requirements Although a complete budgetary process map has already been developed it is anticipated that processes will continually evolve and improve 6 2 2 U Financial Management System A new Integrated Financial Management System IFMS is currently being implemented and is expected to be at Full Operating Capacity FOC as of l October 1999 The first module was implemented on I October I 997 The system will be used to account for monitor and track budgetary resources for the NRO as well as providing information for the evaluation of management controls 6 3 Key External Factors Impeding Goal Accomplishment U 6 3 1 U Changes in External Oversight Requirements Changes in how and when information is due to external oversight organizations will influence the degree to which the NRO can develop and sustain financial management processes that optimize the use of resources The NRO financial management process responds to requirements from the DoD CMS and six congressional committees As the requirements from these organizations change in any given year the NRO must modify its internal processes to permit responsive and timely actions Page 6 - 2 llaalllt 1i11 R¥1 iH t H Tit LEN'f lff 7l'tt8LE Channels Julndy

ffective budgeting and planning is crucial in today's environment ofshrinking resources This goal focuses on improving our budget build process to make it more open and corporate and conducting better budget execution reviews to provide insight into NRO programs and to gather feedback on progress being made These processes in conjunction with the development ofa resource allocation procedure manual and a resource allocation milestone calendar willprovide valuable NRO resource information to all managers Besides improving our internal financial control better execution in these areas will improve

in the upcoming Annual Performance Plan 6 5 4 U Data Capacity The following candidate performance measures are currently being tracked and will be used to measure progress toward the achievement of Goal IO U Execution Performance This measure reflects our management ofresources based on our requirements Obligations and expenditures will be tracked over time and analyzed against standard Department of Defense DoD metrics This measure will track our current performance against targeted performance levels and indicate whether our program is phased properly with financing U This measure provides the DNRO with a reliable gauge of our corporate ability to manage our programs within a given level of resources This measure provides our stakeholders with insight into the financial health of our programs U Number and Value ofReprogrammings This metric wiII measure how well the budget was initially planned and aligned by tracking the number of times and the amount of both external and internal reprogramrnings This metric will inherently identify program savings realignment resources The goal is to have properly allocated budget resources against NRO program priorities by the time the CBJB is submitted to the Congress thereby minimizing reprogramming requirements U Timely Resolution of Defined Discrepancies A significant measure of successful implementation and operation of a corporate financial management system is the number of discrepancies identified by either the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act FMFIA management control self - assessment process or by external reviews conducted by the Inspectors General oflhe NRO the DoD and or the Central InteUigence Agency CIA The ultimate objective is to achieve unqualified affirmation of financial management system operations and identify no discrepancies Recognizing the complexity and scope of the challenges a practical approach is to close any identified discrepancies within 24 months of identification and to close approximately one - third of the identified discrepancies in the first 12 months U All discrepancies identified will be tracked as part of the FMFIA management control program and those items that have been closed will be documented with a memorandum approved by the Deputy Director of the NRO DDNRO and the ROM This will provide for action tracking within the context of an existing mechanism and ensure periodic status and timely resolution is documented U Number of Official Questions for the Record QFRs This measure depicts the total number of official Questions for the Record QFRs Some volume ofQFRs are necessary expected and invited The objective is to limit the number ofQFRs to a level that does not unduly burden program offices U Days Late or Early Meeting Key Financial Deadlines This measure looks at the timeliness of financial information provided by the NRO to the DCI and the Deputy Secretary of Defense 0MB and Congress By tracking whether or not the NRO met or exceeded the due dates of the IPOM the BES the CBJB and annual financial statements it can be determined if the NRO is providing timely financial information The timeliness of financial information provides an indicator to the DNRO on the ability to comply with official deadlines and provides an indicator as to the level of reliability that our oversight entities have in NRO financial data Page

The NRO has implemented a comprehensive program evaluation approach to achieve two primary objectives First the program evaluation approach must ensure that current programs are on course to enable the NRO to achieve its corporate goals The second objective is to ensure that each expended program dollar results in the maximwn possible benefit for our customers The processes in place to achieve each of these objectives are presented below Strategic - Level Program Evaluation U U At the corporate level the NRO has identified ten strategic goals and has committed resources in a variety of programs to achieve these goals in the coming years Organizational performance monitored through our corporate - level measures will enable senior management to assess whether funded programs are delivering desired results U As discussed previously in this document NRO measures include leading indicators of performance in our core business areas such as research and development acquisition and operations These measures are balanced with lagging indicators including survey results that enable management to evaluate whether our processes are resulting in benefits to our customer base This corporate - level view ofNRO programs allows senior management to consider the effect of all programs in the aggregate since many programs have an impact on performance against each corporate measure U The NRO has already implemented a quarterly performance review to assess organizational performance and discuss the status of current programs The measures presented in this forum will be incorporated into the new strategic planning process and wilI be included in annual NRO performance plans and annual performance reports as they are developed U The NRO also actively uses several cross - community panels to evaluate the strategic impacts of its major programs The Director ofthe NRO DNRO has established the NRO Advisory Panel the NRO Gold Team and various program review panels to ensure that customers and stakeholders are informed and actively participate in major decisions In addition the DNRO invites industry partners semi - annually to meet with NRO personnel and share ideas These forums though strategic in nature often focus on technical program assessment and issues involving the technical details of information superiority Individual Program Evaluation U U The NRO is responsible for its systems from cradle to grave A program office is established at the inception of a program and sees it through concept definition system development testing production launch and on - orbit operations Each phase of this life cycle is carefully managed and mechanisms are in place to ensure that each program delivers its expected value The source documents for managing this process are the NRO Acquisition Manual NAM and NRO Directive NROD 82 - 2 U Below two of the key forums for evaluating programs are introduced - - the NRO Acquisition Board NAB outlined in NROD 82 - 2 and the Quarterly Program Review QPR U NROD 82 - 2 the NAB The overarching policy for managing the acquisition process is NROD 82 - 2 Under NROD 822 programs are structured in four phases that translate broadly stated mission needs into well - defined system - specific requirements These phases are separated by key decision points KDPs The interrelationship between program

at four KDPs across what is typically a multi - year program lif To keep the DNRO and DDNRO informed between KDPs the NRO has instituted a quarterly forum to review program pn The QPR provides Program Managers with the opportunity to update program progress inform management of tactica program decisions and seek assistance where necessary Programs that are proceeding successfully rely on the QPR primary forum to provide status Programs that require additional oversight or assistance are reviewed more frequently forums Program Evaluation Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 GPRA U U As the NRO continues to comply with the requirements of the GPRA formats for its annual performance plans and performance reports are being developed The NRO envisions that these reports will serve as the cornerstone docume evaluating program performance and for communicating organizational results In Sections 3 through 6 of this doc outcomes and candidate performance measures are provided

Based on the Jeremiah Panel Report of 26 August 1996 as well as the Joint Central Intelligence Agency CIA Department of Defense Inspector General DoDIG reports the NRO has identified two major management problems The NRO and its stakeholders including the Director of Central Intelligence DCI and the Secretary of Defense SECDEF have taken steps to investigate these problems and develop a course of action to improve in each identified area Below each problem is briefly introduced along with improvement initiatives currently underway Customer Relationships U U The Jeremiah Panel indicated that nontraditional customers' understanding ofNRO system capabilities was elementary and often confused by security and technology Specific examples include inconsistency in use of reconnaissance information a belief that there is no financial impact associated with NRO products and dissatisfaction among end users The resulting confusion has eroded customer relationships Based on these observations the NRO has begun to design a customer support process that is inclusive balanced consistent and accountable in partnership with stakeholders The process will be flexible allowing for centralized management planning and oversight and decentralized execution NRO leaders will be appointed to support customers of current tasking and dissemination and to derive future customer needs for new system designs requirements and architectures Lead responsibilities for supporting national and military customers will be identified and carried out in coordination with discipline managers This new approach to customer relations will provide for requirements and capability analysis and a strong emphasis on innovative and cost effective technical solutions U The NRO is actively addressing this issue One of the four perspectives framing the corporate strategic plan customer satisfaction is the focus of the first three corporate strategic goals Additionally a Customer Support Implementation Plan is currently being developed In an effort to maintain open communication with key mission partners the Director of the NRO DNRO conducts quarterly exchanges with counterparts in the National Security Agency NSA and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency NIMA Spending Accountability U U As a result of the Joint CIA DoDIG audits excessive funding and the need for accountability of expenditures have been identified as leading management problems at the NRO Non - compliance with the audit findings provided the impetus for the NRO senior leadership to modify the financial management process and more closely monitor the allocation of funds New policies procedures and processes were developed to ensure that the budget for the NRO would be closely monitored in execution Officials in the DCI Community Management Staff CMS and the Department of Defense Comptroller's office required that the NRO conduct budget execution reviews and submit status reports of its financial health in order to provide proof of compliance U Additionally the NRO is actively seeking compliance with the Chief Financial Officer's CFO's Act The NRO has begun implementation of a new transaction - driven accounting system that will produce auditable NRO financial statements for fiscal year 1998 These financial statements will be audited by the DoD and CIA Office of the Inspector General OIG In preparation of the fiscal year 1998 financial statements and their subsequent audit the NRO is initiating an effort to identify and correct any deficiencies which could hamper compliance Page 8 3 - 1 SIWRE'f llantlle is B¥BP Ml 'U 'f2'LElN'f l ElYH0LE Channels fointt Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 C05106746 Approved for Release 2017 12 04 C05106746 Sl 1CRE'f 8 4 NRO ROLES AND CROSS - CUTTING FUNCTIONS U U The NRO mission states that it is responsible for unique and innovative technology large scale systems engineering development and acquisition and operation of space reconnaissance systems By executing this mission the NRO is the U S government's primary provider of space - based intelligence and operational support Although its mission is unique many NRO core competencies are similar to those found at other agencies and the NRO proactively collaborates with these agencies to ensure that redundancies are minimized U Figure 11 below illustrates the NRO role in the intelligence cycle This cycle begins with the definition of customer needs through collection management which is conducted by NRO mission partners' Requirements are given a priority and provided to the NRO and the NRO collects and processes intelligence products Once processed the information is exploited and disseminated by mission partners who also archive products for future use Unclassified Figure I I U The Intelligence Cycle U NRO programs are selected and managed with the objective of providing optimal support to the collection and processing U NRO mission partners include the National Security Agency NSA the National Imagery and Mapping Agency NIMA the Central Measurement and Signature Intelligence Office CMO the Central Intelligence Agency CIA the Defense Intelligence

developing and deploying these collection and processing systems Each phase is presented below with an explanation of where it cross - cuts other organizations and what the NRO is doing to minimize redundancies Research and Development U U The NRO research and development efforts ultimately provide many of the technological advances that have established U S preeminence in space - based reconnaissance To ensure that this position is maintained in the future the NRO proactively works as a partner with external agencies that conduct similar types of research and development efforts This collaborative emphasis conserves NRO research dollars and reduces duplication of efforts in the Federal Government The annual NRO Technology Forum is an example of ongoing efforts to bring industry and government together to share requirements and capabilities and to explore opportunities for collaboration Acquisition U U Like many organizations in the Government the NRO expends significant effort to ensure that products and services are acquired as efficiently and effectively as possible The NRO has established an Acquisition Center of Excellence ACE which frequently interacts with external agencies to identify and implement best acquisition practices The Acquisition Steering Group ASG shares these ideas internally U Several federal organizations acquire satellites and the NRO recognizes the synergy of working with and learning from these organizations The recent establishment of the Air Force NRO Integration Planning Group IPG is representative of efforts to form partnerships with external acquisition organizations Operations U b 1 b 3 Other Cross - Cutting Functions U U In addition to the NRO core areas discussed above there are two other functions inherent to the NRO that cross - cut with other organizations in the Intelligence Community IC and DoD U Customer Interaction Though the intelligence cycle illustrated in Figure 7 shows that mission partners are primarily responsible for direct customer interaction the NRO also interacts with its users Within the NRO the Operational Support Office OSO and several of the directorates have ongoing direct relationships with customers U The NRO recognizes the importance of coordinated customer support and has developed a Customer Support Board CSB and a Customer Support Implementation Plan CSIP to improve these interactions The NRO strategic direction also calls for improvement in our relationships with mission partners strategic Goal 3 quarterly exchanges with NIMA NSA DIA and CIA and CMO are conducted to coordinate on issues of common concern U Financial Within the IC and DoD financial management redundancies result from systems and processes that are not integrated For example the DoD Planning Programming and Budgeting system is similar to the IC Capabilities Programming and Budgeting System but they are executed separately These financial management problems are beyond the scope of the NRO but they create cross - cutting redundancies that adversely impact the NRO in terms of budget development execution and reporting requirements Handle • ia B¥1iiH • Page 8 4
